# RolesBasedWebAPI2Demo
This is a VERY BASIC demonstration/implementation of OAuth 2/Roles-based Authorization in ASP.NET Web API 2

This project as it is DOES NOT implement HTTPS... If you choose to use this as boilerplate code, make sure you IMPLEMENT HTTPS before you put it up live or else the security will be compromised.
